# Exercises - Chapter 03 Selecting a Service Platform

1. Compare IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS on the basis of cost, configurability, and control (hint make a chart)
    1. Iaas (Infrastructure as a Service):
        - Cost: Lowest (Computer and network hardware, real or virtual, ready for you to use. Can be costly depending on design or service provider)
        - Configurability: Highest (lots of coordination of many pieces)
        - Control: Highest (total control of the OS)
    2. PaaS (Platform as a Service):
        - Cost: Medium (Software running in a vendor-provided framework or stack. Can be costly depending on design or service provider)
        - Configurability: Medium (all aspects managed by the vendor)
        - Control: Medium (restricted to only what the vendor provides)
    3. SaaS (Software as a Service):
        - Cost: Highest (app provided as a website or web-accessible application. Can be costly due to â€œdesigning the service to obscure upgrades and other operational details")
        - Configurability: Lowest (all aspects managed by the provider)
        - Control: Lowest (users don't have operation responsibilities)

2. What are the caveats to consider in adopting Software as a Service?
    - Upgraded frequently, often without warning, providing little opportunity for training.
    - avoid features that require client software or browser plug-ins.
    - Make it easy for customers to get started using the service.
    -  people can leave the service in a self-service manner.

3. List the key advantages of virtual machines.
    -  VMs are more efficient since it's so customizable. It allows for reduction of stranded capacity, making it easy and fast to create and destroy VMs. They can also be assigned to specific tasks. VMs are also programmable and can be moved between physical machines.

4. Why might you choose physical over virtual machines?
    - Physical machines can be high maintenance (updates, monitoring, etc.) and unpredictable with "steal time".

5. Which factors might make you choose private over public cloud services?
    - privacy of information
    - long-term use of cloud
    - degree of control
