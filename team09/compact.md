# Code of Conduct
* How work will flow:
    * We as a team will communicate with each other on our specific tasks. Each team member will have access to our collaborated VS code. 
* Communication methods:
    * **Discord**
        * This will be our primary means of communcation. All project related information will be available on our channel. Access is restricted for a person or entity outside of this team. 
    * **e-mail**
        * Email is our secondary mean of communcation. If a team member can't use discord under *any circumstances*, then email will be another option. 
    * **Trello**
        * In order to be able to connect the kanban board to discord, we will use Trello for the backlog, to do, in progress, testing, done.
        * This will be our Kanban board. 
* Communication rules:
    * **Discord**
        * All changes that made in discord should be notified in advance before making any changes. 
        * Make sure that all changes is already pushed to github and the changes also showed up on [#github-log](https://ptb.discord.com/channels/933027597980414002/935937906193883209) on discord.
        * Make sure to response when someone ask the specific member what the progress of their tasks are. If that member is not respond but sending deliverable, the project manager will check the update to make sure everything is made correctly. However, if the member is not responding to the chat and **not** sending contribution 24 hour before due date, the project manager are allowed to send a report to the professor of the problems.
    * **Trello**
        * All to-do list, in progress, and what has been done should be wrote in the kanban board and nothing should be deleted from the kanban board.
        * Make sure that all changes that the member did to the trello such as move, assign member, adding due date is saved and showed up on [#trello-log](https://ptb.discord.com/channels/933027597980414002/936736791120207902). 
* Consequences:
    * Each member will participate equally in this project.
    * Failure to delivery assign task will affect group performance. This can result in late group submission, inadequate group presentation, and class performance.
    * Multiple miss deadline can result in poor grade for this class. 
* Restoration methods:
    * Github restoration system
     * **A dev branch**
        * Since there are multiple people working at the same time on our git repo, this can create problems when pushing code. Even though, we are communication before making any changes, there are chances that someone might delete something by accident or not make a pull request before pushing their code. 
        * In order to avoid that, we will create another branch call dev. This branch will be out developer branch where all the code will get pushed initially. This will keep our main branch clean and error proof. If anything goes wrong, then we can delete the dev branch and create a new one where we can start fresh.
