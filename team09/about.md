# About
The general scope of our project involves a web application where the user being able to reserve a ticket for a space exploration trip. The user is presented with a welcome page describing what the trip is going to be about and a button to be able to book now. The user will proceed to a login/sign in system upon pressing the book now button. This will lead to a page where the user will then be able to book a ticket for the space exploration trip. After logging in, in the homepage there will be a my trips button that will show information about the user's current reservation(s).

The user will also be able to navigate through different pages for more information. The user will be able to open up pages which will include information on the company, the destination, staff, etc. If the user is in need of assistance or has any questions, there will be a support page in which will include FAQs and an option to send a message to the support team for further assistance. The goal of the web application is to provide a quick and seamless transaction for reservations, while also providing additional information and/or support that the user may need.
