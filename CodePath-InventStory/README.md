## Overview
### Description
Our Inventory App seeks to provide an exhaustive databse for our user's belongings, ranging from their groceries, electronics, clothes, etc.
Users will be able to keep track of their personal inventories, as well as shared inventories for group living situations such as families or roomates.
The app will allow users to add items in several ways: manually type in the item information, scan a barcode to auto-populate the data, or check off an item in a shopping list to update the count of an item. Users will also be able to remove items as needed. There will be a shopping list feature in which users may check off items as they shop in store, updating their inventory database with each item.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Database, Item Tracking
- **Mobile:** Mobile first experience, uses camera
- **Story:** Allows users to organize their groceries and belongings, enabling them ease of access and a streamlined shopping procedure.
- **Market:** Anyone that appreciates organization for their items and groceries would appreciate this app. Ability to view, track, and update their inventory as needed allows users to stay organized as well as share a communication platform for necessites across a household.
- **Habit:** Users will likely open the app at least once a week, if not more. The app will store household items as well as groceries, which are typically shopped for at least once a week or every two weeks. Very habit forming!
- **Scope:** The app will start out as just an inventory tracker and associated shopping list. However, it has the potential to support in-app messaging between members of a shared inventory as well as in-app shopping, possibly through Food/Grocery Delivery APIs.
