# Chapter 1
# How to create world-class agility, reliability, and security in technology organizations

## DevOps is not only for startups

## DevOps replaces Agile?

* No way!
* DevOps practices are compatible with Agile processes
* Agile and DevOps require each other

## DevOps mean eliminating IT Operations?
* No!
* SOme interpret DevOps as put everything on the cloud and lay off your IT staff.
* This is a terrible strategy as someone always needs to manage your infrastructure.
* But instead of IT Operations just doing manual work - with automation those IT people are freed up to work on problems impacting the business.

## DevOps is just "Infrastructure as Code" or Automation
* Partially - automation and IaaC are large parts of what makes DevOps thinking possible, but they themselves are not DevOps
* DevOps requires cultural norms to work, not just a set of tools

## DevOps is only for open source software
* No!
* While true that opensource software and distribution through GitHub of projects has enabled the DevOps ideas to be widely implemented, opensource is just one component
* Can be done with any platform you use in the business

## DevOps is incompatible with Information Security
* No!
* The term "Security" is not in DevOps, but that dosen't mean DevOps is anarchy

## DevOps -- Professor made this up - no one use it?
* This was a real quote
* DevOps is also an inspirational goal - something you are constantly working towards - not a state to achieve
* Remember its not a tool or software - it's a set of principles
* We will learn how this paradigm will impact your daily work

# An Introduction to The DevOps Handbook
Imagine a world where:
* Product owners, Development, QA, IT, InfoSec all work together
* They help each other
* They help the overall organization succeed

How?
* All working towards a common goal
* This enables fast flow of panned work into production
* Achieves world-class reliability, availability, and security

## Not a perfect world
These are our ideals

But this generally isn't how our world works
* Generally, the systems we inherit are broken
* Out-dated policies, policial in-fighting, lack of clear goals
* Developers and Operations are enemies
* Long lead times to product or feature release

Lead to frustration, depression, poor business outcomes
* Even layoffs and job uncertainty

DevOps is looking to fix the way we work
* And the work culture to improve lives, not just business
