## Course Catalog Description

In this capstone course, students will identify, gather, analyze, and write requirements based on user needs and will then design, construct, integrate, and implement an information system as a solution to a business problem.  Students will document integration architecture, methodologies, and technologies using industry best practices.  User needs and user centered design will be applied in the selection, creation, evaluation, and administration of the resulting system.  The system design process will take into account professional, ethical, legal, security, and social issues and responsibilities and stress the local and global impact of computing on individuals, organizations, and society.  Discussion will also cover the need to engage in continuing professional development. [ITMT 430 Bulletin Description](http://bulletin.iit.edu/courses/itmt/ "ITMT 430 Bulletin Description")

### Academic Honesty

All work you submit in this course must be your own.

### Plagiarism

Dealing with code -- you need to respect opensource licenses and in the absence of a clear license be careful cutting and pasting code without attributing source. A good metric would be to add a comment in your code with a link to the original source to protect yourself.

This class won't be dealing with formal written papers.

### Disabilities

Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with documented disabilities.  In order to receive accommodations, students must obtain a letter of accommodation from the Center for Disability Resources and make an appointment to speak with me as soon as possible.  My office hours are listed on the first page of the syllabus. The Center for Disability Resources (CDR) is located in 3424 S. State St., room 1C3-2 (on the first floor), telephone 312 567.5744 or disabilities@iit.edu

### ARC Tutoring Center

The university provides a free tutoring and study center called the [ARC](https://www.iit.edu/arc "IIT Resource Center URL").  This is located newly in the basement of the Galvin Library and is open to all for walk in appointments as well as scheduled tutoring.

### Illinois Tech Sexual Harassment and Discrimination Information

Illinois Tech prohibits all sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, and gender discrimination by any member of our community. This includes harassment among students, staff, or faculty. Sexual harassment of a student by a faculty member or sexual harassment of an employee by a supervisor is particularly serious. Such conduct may easily create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment.

Illinois Tech encourages anyone experiencing sexual harassment or sexual misconduct to speak with the Office of Title IX Compliance for information on support options and the resolution process. You can report sexual harassment electronically at [iit.edu/incidentreport](iit.edu/incidentreport "IIT Incident Report URL"), which may be completed anonymously. You may additionally report by contacting the Title IX Coordinator, Virginia Foster at foster@iit.edu or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator, Esther Espeland at eespeland@iit.edu.

For confidential support, you may reach Illinois Tech’s Confidential Advisor at (773) 907-1062. You can also contact a licensed practitioner in Illinois Tech’s Student Health and Wellness Center at student.health@iit.edu or (312)567-7550

For a comprehensive list of resources regarding counseling services, medical assistance, legal assistance and visa and immigration services, you can visit the Office of Title IX Compliance website at [https://www.iit.edu/title-ix/resources](https://www.iit.edu/title-ix/resources "IIT Title IX resources").

### COVID-19 Precautions and Face Coverings in Class

Illinois Tech students are required to be vaccinated, to have a booster as soon as you are eligible, and to wear face masks at all times when indoors. In general, individuals should spend as little time as practicable in closer proximity when doing so is necessary to achieve learning objectives. Students who are feeling ill or experiencing symptoms such as sneezing, coughing, or a higher than normal temperature will be excused from class and are expected to stay at home.

Instructors have the right to ask those who are not complying with these requirements to leave class in the interest of everyone's health and safety. In the event that a student refuses to comply with instructor directions regarding face masks, the instructor has the right to ask the student to leave, and/or cancel class. A student who refuses to comply with these requirements will be referred to the Office of the Dean of Students for possible disciplinary action under the Student Code of Conduct.

Additionally, as a reminder, following other simple practices such as frequent and thorough hand washing, wiping down desks and seats with disinfectant wipes when possible, not sharing personal items such as pens and cell phones, and avoiding crowded hallways and other enclosed spaces will promote good health in and out of the classroom.
