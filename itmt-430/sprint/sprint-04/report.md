* Self-Critique what I did and what you have gone better:
    * Making sure that all documentation for this sprint is clear enough so my teammate could run it without getting any problem. Because, right now, some of my teammate still does not know how to access the website that we developing until now. Also, making sure everyone in the team know how to access the website from proxmox server.

## Group-Critique

1. Priyank Mithapara:
    * **Critique**: For sprint 04, Priyank is really helpful when dealing with ideas, improvement of the website / the front end using EJS and how can the team leader seperate the work for the other member.

    * **Contributions**: Being a team leader and creating the [about-us page](https://github.com/illinoistech-itm/2022-team09w/blob/main/code/views/about-us.ejs) for the team where he will include the information about the team members and the team name. Also, being the second eye for me when fixing the bugs on database on proxmox server.

    * **Improvements**: TBA

3. Ayobami Adebowale:
    * **Critique**: Lack of communication between team member who willing to help her on her problem regarding her laptop where it seems she always busy with something that make her teammate to be confused. Also, she start doing the task that she was assigned to her three days before the sprint.

    * **Contributions**: Nothing

    * **Improvements**: More communication between team member and more active on the chat where she seems to be missing when the leader asking her about something. Also, a nice information from her to the teammate when can she start her task.
