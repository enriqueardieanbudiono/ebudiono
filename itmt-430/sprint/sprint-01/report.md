# sprint-01
## Self-Critique
* Roles:
    * Leading the team for sprint 01 as a project manager / team leader where I need to assign some task to the team member to make sure everything is going smoothly before the deadline.
* Jobs:
    1.  Adding .gitignore 
    2.  Adding some information on compact.md file
    3.  Creating a webhook that connect github with discord server
    4.  Creating trello for kanban board
    5.  Connecting trello to discord server
    6.  Assigning task for each team member
* Detail the work that accomplished and delivered:
    * Code of conduct markdown file ([compact.md](https://github.com/illinoistech-itm/2022-team09w/blob/main/compact.md))
    * Readme file: Assign the team member name and their role.
* Self-Critique what I did and what you have gone better:
    * During sprint 01, some of my team did not respond to my message that I put on the chat where basically, I asked them when can we do the meeting or how can we finish the work before the due date. However, I believe this is also my mistake where I'm trying to cover everything that I could and have lack of communication with team member who only contribute a little bit to the project. From the sprint-01, I could see that I should improve my communication with my teeammate and making sure everyone is working equally 

## Group-Critique

1. Priyank Mithapara:
    * Critique: For sprint 01, Priyank is really helpful when dealing with ideas, improvement  for compact.md and how can the team leader seperate the work for the other member.

    * Contributions: Giving ideas for the project, creating the compact.md / code of conduct, setup a meeting for the team, creating the ERD design for the project.

    * Improvements: For sprint 01, I think Priyank already give his best for this sprint

2. John Hernandez:
    * Critique: For sprint 01, John is helping a lot where he helping us creating a scratch ideas of the project design and creating what the about.md looks like.

    * Contributions: John is really helping the team when creating the compact.md where he trying to ask his team opinion on how everything should be written and thinking to the future for what will happen. He also contributing a lot in about.md and project design ideas. Also, he is the one who convert the content of the project idea into what I could see on about.md.

    * Improvements: For sprint 01, I think John already give his best for this sprint.
3. Ayobami Adebowale:
    * Critique: No communication between teammate and the team leader about what is going on with her or what could she do to help her team to finsih the sprint 01. Not attending the meeting or even replying if she could attend or not. Sometimes she does not respond to the team member when someone asking her for her availablity for the meeting.

    * Contributions: Creating the UI Design for Design #1, but unable to push it to github because of problem on her end.

    * Improvements: Improve her communication with teammate to make her teammate know when to have a meeting or how can the leader seperate the team work without letting the team dragging her while she did not contribute anything to the project.
